Here are two possible ways of expressing this:\n///\n/// ```dart\n/// _animation = _controller.drive(\n///   Tween<Offset>(\n///     begin: const Offset(100.0, 50.0),\n///     end: const Offset(200.0, 300.0),\n///   ),\n/// );\n/// ```\n/// {@end-tool}\n/// {@tool snippet}\n///\n/// ```dart\n/// _animation = Tween<Offset>(\n///   begin: const Offset(100.0, 50.0),\n///   end: const Offset(200.0, 300.0),\n/// ).animate(_controller);\n/// ```\n/// {@end-tool}\n///\n/// In both cases, the `_animation` variable holds an object that, over the\n/// lifetime of the `_controller`'s animation, returns a value\n/// (`_animation.value`) that depicts a point along the line between the two\n/// offsets above. If we used a [MaterialPointArcTween] instead of a\n/// [Tween<Offset>] in the code above, the points would follow a pleasing curve\n/// instead of a straight line, with no other changes necessary.\n///\n/// ## Performance optimizations\n///\n/// Tweens are mutable; specifically, their [begin] and [end] values can be\n/// changed at runtime. An object created with [Animation.drive] using a [Tween]\n/// will immediately honor changes to that underlying [Tween] (though the\n/// listeners will only be triggered if the [Animation] is actively animating).\n/// This can be used to change an animation on the fly without having to\n/// recreate all the objects in the chain from the [AnimationController] to the\n/// final [Tween].\n///\n/// If a [Tween]'s values are never changed, however, a further optimization can\n/// be applied: the object can be stored in a `static final` variable, so that\n/// the exact same instance is used whenever the [Tween] is needed. This is\n/// preferable to creating an identical [Tween] afresh each time a [State.build]\n/// method is called, for example.\n///\n/// ## Types with special considerations\n///\n/// Classes with [lerp] static methods typically have corresponding dedicated\n/// [Tween] subclasses that call that method. For example, [ColorTween] uses\n/// [Color.lerp] to implement the [ColorTween.lerp] method.\n///\n/// Types that define `+` and `-` operators to combine values (`T + T → T` and\n/// `T - T → T`) and an `*` operator to scale by multiplying with a double (`T *\n/// double → T`) can be directly used with `Tween<T>`.\n///\n/// This does not extend to any type with `+`, `-`, and `*` operators. In\n/// particular, [int] does not satisfy this precise contract (`int * double`\n/// actually returns [num], not [int]). There are therefore two specific classes\n/// that can be used to interpolate integers:\n///\n///  * [IntTween], which is an approximation of a linear interpolation (using\n///    [double.round]).\n///  * [StepTween], which uses [double.floor] to ensure that the result is\n///    never greater than it would be using if a `Tween<double>`.\n///\n/// The relevant operators on [Size] also don't fulfill this contract, so\n/// [SizeTween] uses [Size.lerp].\n///\n/// In addition, some of the types that _do_ have suitable `+`, `-`, and `*`\n/// operators still have dedicated [Tween] subclasses that perform the\n/// interpolation in a more specialized manner. One such class is\n/// [MaterialPointArcTween], which is mentioned above. The [AlignmentTween], and\n/// [AlignmentGeometryTween], and [FractionalOffsetTween] are another group of\n/// [Tween]s that use dedicated `lerp` methods instead of merely relying on the\n/// operators (in particular, this allows them to handle null values in a more\n/// useful manner).\n///\n/// ## Nullability\n///\n/// The [begin] and [end] fields are nullable; a [Tween] does not have to\n/// have non-null values specified when it is created.\n///\n/// If `T` is nullable, then [lerp] and [transform] may return null.\n/// This is typically seen in the case where [begin] is null and `t`\n/// is 0.0, or [end] is null and `t` is 1.0, or both are null (at any\n/// `t` value).\n///\n/// If `T` is not nullable, then [begin] and [end] must both be set to\n/// non-null values before using [lerp] or [transform], otherwise they\n/// will throw.\n///\n/// ## Implementing a Tween\n///\n/// To specialize this class for a new type, the subclass should implement\n/// the [lerp] method (and a constructor). The other methods of this class\n/// are all defined in terms of [lerp].",

Consider having higher-level widgets in the tree\n/// pass lower-level widgets the [Animation] itself, rather than its value,\n/// in order to avoid rebuilding the higher-level widgets on each frame\n/// even while the animation is active.\n/// If the leaf widgets also ignore [value] and pass the whole\n/// [Animation] object to a render object (like [FadeTransition] does),\n/// they too might be able to avoid rebuild and even relayout, so that the\n/// only work needed on each frame of the animation is to repaint.\n///\n/// See also:\n///\n///  * [ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget] and its subclasses, which provide\n///    animation effects without the need to manually work with [Animation],\n///    [AnimationController], or even [State].\n///  * [AnimationController], an animation you can run forward and backward,\n///    stop, or set to a specific value.\n///  * [Tween], which can be used to convert [Animation<double>]s into\n///    other kinds of [Animation]s.\n///  * [AnimatedWidget] and its subclasses, which provide animation effects\n///    that can be controlled by an [Animation].",

        "documentation": "/// A controller for an animation.\n///\n/// This class lets you perform tasks such as:\n///\n/// * Play an animation [forward] or in [reverse], or [stop] an animation.\n/// * Set the animation to a specific [value].\n/// * Define the [upperBound] and [lowerBound] values of an animation.\n/// * Create a [fling] animation effect using a physics simulation.\n///\n/// By default, an [AnimationController] linearly produces values that range\n/// from 0.0 to 1.0, during a given duration.\n///\n/// When the animation is actively animating, the animation controller generates\n/// a new value each time the device running your app is ready to display a new\n/// frame (typically, this rate is around 60–120 values per second).\n/// If the animation controller is associated with a [State]\n/// through a [TickerProvider], then its updates will be silenced when that\n/// [State]'s subtree is disabled as defined by [TickerMode]; time will still\n/// elapse, and methods like [forward] and [stop] can still be called and\n/// will change the value, but the controller will not generate new values\n/// on its own.\n///\n/// ## Ticker providers\n///\n/// An [AnimationController] needs a [TickerProvider], which is configured using\n/// the `vsync` argument on the constructor.\n/// The constructor uses the [TickerProvider] to create a [Ticker], which\n/// the [AnimationController] uses to step through the animation it controls.\n///\n/// For advice on obtaining a ticker provider, see [TickerProvider].\n/// Typically the relevant [State] serves as the ticker provider,\n/// after applying a suitable mixin (like [SingleTickerProviderStateMixin])\n/// to cause the [State] subclass to implement [TickerProvider].\n///\n/// ## Life cycle\n///\n/// An [AnimationController] should be [dispose]d when it is no longer needed.\n/// This reduces the likelihood of leaks. When used with a [StatefulWidget], it\n/// is common for an [AnimationController] to be created in the\n/// [State.initState] method and then disposed in the [State.dispose] method.\n///\n/// ## Using [Future]s with [AnimationController]\n///\n/// The methods that start animations return a [TickerFuture] object which\n/// completes when the animation completes successfully, and never throws an\n/// error; if the animation is canceled, the future never completes. This object\n/// also has a [TickerFuture.orCancel] property which returns a future that\n/// completes when the animation completes successfully, and completes with an\n/// error when the animation is aborted.\n///\n/// This can be used to write code such as the `fadeOutAndUpdateState` method\n/// below.\n///\n/// {@tool snippet}\n///\n/// Here is a stateful `Foo` widget. Its [State] uses the\n/// [SingleTickerProviderStateMixin] to implement the necessary\n/// [TickerProvider], creating its controller in the [State.initState] method\n/// and disposing of it in the [State.dispose] method. The duration of the\n/// controller is configured from a property in the `Foo` widget; as that\n/// changes, the [State.didUpdateWidget] method is used to update the\n/// controller.\n///\n/// ```dart\n/// class Foo extends StatefulWidget {\n///   const Foo({ super.key, required this.duration });\n///\n///   final Duration duration;\n///\n///   @override\n///   State<Foo> createState() => _FooState();\n/// }\n///\n/// class _FooState extends State<Foo> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {\n///   late AnimationController _controller;\n///\n///   @override\n///   void initState() {\n///     super.initState();\n///     _controller = AnimationController(\n///       vsync: this, // the SingleTickerProviderStateMixin\n///       duration: widget.duration,\n///     );\n///   }\n///\n///   @override\n///   void didUpdateWidget(Foo oldWidget) {\n///     super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);\n///     _controller.duration = widget.duration;\n///   }\n///\n///   @override\n///   void dispose() {\n///     _controller.dispose();\n///     super.dispose();\n///   }\n///\n///   @override\n///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n///     return Container(); // ...\n///   }\n/// }\n/// ```\n/// {@end-tool}\n/// {@tool snippet}\n///\n/// The following method (for a [State] subclass) drives two animation\n/// controllers using Dart's asynchronous syntax for awaiting [Future] objects:\n///\n/// ```dart\n/// Future<void> fadeOutAndUpdateState() async {\n///   try {\n///     await fadeAnimationController.forward().orCancel;\n///     await sizeAnimationController.forward().orCancel;\n///     setState(() {\n///       dismissed = true;\n///     });\n///   } on TickerCanceled {\n///     // the animation got canceled, probably because we were disposed\n///   }\n/// }\n/// ```\n/// {@end-tool}\n///\n/// The assumption in the code above is that the animation controllers are being\n/// disposed in the [State] subclass' override of the [State.dispose] method.\n/// Since disposing the controller cancels the animation (raising a\n/// [TickerCanceled] exception), the code here can skip verifying whether\n/// [State.mounted] is still true at each step. (Again, this assumes that the\n/// controllers are created in [State.initState] and disposed in\n/// [State.dispose], as described in the previous section.)\n///\n/// {@tool dartpad}\n/// This example shows how to use [AnimationController] and\n/// [SlideTransition] to create an animated digit like you might find\n/// on an old pinball machine our your car's odometer.  New digit\n/// values slide into place from below, as the old value slides\n/// upwards and out of view. Taps that occur while the controller is\n/// already animating cause the controller's\n/// [AnimationController.duration] to be reduced so that the visuals\n/// don't fall behind.\n///\n/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/animation/animation_controller/animated_digit.0.dart **\n/// {@end-tool}\n///\n/// See also:\n///\n///  * [Tween], the base class for converting an [AnimationController] to a\n///    range of values of other types.",
